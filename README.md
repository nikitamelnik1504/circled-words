# CircledWords

Circled word - is a label in border with unique animation. It could be very simple, like fade transition of text color, and it could be very difficult, like pulse animation with multiple colors. It’s very similar to button, let’s call it button.

Every button has own animation(transition) duration, start text color, start border color and etc. Our project wants to show you, how simple web animation can do something especial and beautifull.
