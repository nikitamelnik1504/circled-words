        Circled word - is label in a border with unique animation. It can be
        very simple and difficult at the same time. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fade transition of text color with background impulse animation.
        </li>
        <li>Background color transition without text color change.</li>
        <li>
          Infinity looped color change of all elements (border, text,
          background, shadow).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="description-text">
        Each button has own animation(transition) duration, start text color,
        start border color and much more...<br /><br />
        Our project wants to show you, how simple web animation can do something
        especial and beautiful.<br /><br />
